### Goal and Value of the Application
This website is meant to be a cute and fun pixel-style "Choose your Pokemon team" inspired application. 

### Usability Principles Considered
For hierarchy, I used a large header to instruct the user on what the application is used for. I used a side bar to organize the filters, sort, and team. The items/dogs are organized in rows of cards which makes it easy to navigate. For learnability, I added concise instructions at the top and clear labels/headers for users to reference. For usability, I match the user's conceptual model of "adding to cart" by using similar verbiage and having the Current Team list out the dogs added to the team. 

### Organization of Components
I created ProductItem, Team, and SortBar components.
